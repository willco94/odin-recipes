        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Marinating your meat is a great way to get extra flavour, and can be done in batches!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>   
            <ul>
                <li>Chicken fillets</li>
                <li>Olive Oil</li>
                <li>Garlic (or Garlic Granules)</li>
                <li>Lemon Juice</li>
                <li>Honey</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a bowl, mix olive oil, one or two minced cloves of garlic, a squirt of lemon juice and honey. Primarily olive oil, but with just below equal part honey.</li>
                <li>Once mixed and properly seasoned to taste, add the chicken into the marinade. Ensure that the marinade is covering the chicken.</li>
                <li>Cover with plastic wrap and refridgerate for 1-4 hours.</li>
                <li>After your desired marinating time, heat a large pan to medium heat and put the chicken in.</li>
                <li>Slowly cook the chicken for about 10-15 minutes, depending on quantity.</li>
                <li>In the final minutes of cooking, raise the heat to near maximum and sear the chicken. This will add colour and enhance flavour.</li>
                <li>Remove from pan. Either enjoy as part of a meal, or refridgerate/freeze for later!</li>
            </ol>
