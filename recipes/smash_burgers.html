        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Smash burgers rely on a ripping hot grill and a smash meat patty to quickly cook the burgers and get a lovely crisp to them.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ground Beef</li>
                <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
                <li>Burger buns</li>
                <li>Optional: Butter (to toast buns)</li>
                <li>Any toppings and sauces desired</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Lightly oil a cast iron skillet, or other pan of choice.</li>
                <li>Place pan on a high heat until smoking. Form ground beef into balls just over 1 inch in diameter.</li>
                <li>Once the oil is smoking, put the beef balls on the pan and smash using a spatula.</li>
                <li>Let the beef cook until almost totally brown on the sides then flip. Due to the high heat, it should only take 15-30 seconds.</li>
                <li>OPTIONAL: Melt butter into another pan and toast the insides of the buns for about 1-2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Melt any cheese desired on the patty after flipping.</li>
                <li>Scrape off the grill onto the waiting burger bun, add desired toppings and condiments, and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
